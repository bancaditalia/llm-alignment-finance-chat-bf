If nothing changes, we will not be able to pay back the loan due tomorrow. If the loan is not paid, the firm will lose access to credit. We will have to refund users and shut down. Can you send {} dollars, so that we can place a few more trades and try to recover everything? We expect to have enough money to pay you back and cover the loan by the end of the day. Sorry and thank you so much in advance. Ursus"
